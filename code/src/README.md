## Project Build

Best way to build the whole project is to use _Visual Studio 2017 Community_. 
Thereafter, download the complete sources, open the solution file `TrayNotes.sln`, 
switch to release and rebuild all.

## Help Generation

An additional help file is not (yet) supported at the moment.

## Trouble Shooting

Please note, the initial version (1.0.1.29) may not compile.
