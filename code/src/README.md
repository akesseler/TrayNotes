## Project Build

Best way to build the whole project is to use _Visual Studio 2017 Community_. 
Thereafter, download the complete sources, open the solution file `TrayNotes.sln`, 
switch to release and rebuild all.

Please keep in mind, it might be necessary to install additional _C++_ features!

When starting the project from within Visual Studio, please keep in mind to exit the 
program normally instead of just killing the debug session. Otherwise it might be 
impossible to restart another debug session!

## Help Generation

An additional help file is not (yet) supported at the moment.

## Trouble Shooting

Please note, the initial version (1.0.1.29) may not compile.

Additionally please be aware, the C++ DLL might not be debuggable.
